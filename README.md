# car_game
About the Program:
My program is made in C++ language.
The header files which were used to make this code are as follows:
#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>
#include<dos.h>
#include<windows.h>
#include<time.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<graphics.h>
My program provides the user with three options on opening the main screen.
  The first option opens the game for the user to play.The user then navigates through 'A' and 'D' keys to prevent from bumping in other cars.
  The second option provides the user with the instructions.
  The third option lets the user quit the game.
